* Abaqus-Like UI Refactor Plan
** Status
   - Overall: In Progress
   - Last Update: 2026-02-21

** Goals
   - Provide an Abaqus-like user experience for model setup, solve, and post-processing.
   - Make the app look and feel like a professional simulation suite.
   - Keep the workflow end-to-end: geometry -> mesh -> solve -> results.

** Plan
*** DONE 1. 信息架构与流程定义
    - Abaqus-style Model Tree:
      Parts / Materials / Sections / Steps / BC / Loads / Interactions / Mesh / Jobs / Results
    - Shortest demo workflow:
      Part -> Material -> Section -> Assembly -> Step -> BC/Load -> Mesh -> Job -> Results
    - UI wireframe + view list:
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+
      | Menu/Toolbar                                                  |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+
      | Modules: Part | Property | Assembly | Step | Interaction |    |
      |          Load | Mesh | Job | Visualization                    |
      +--------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
      | Model Tree         |   Viewport (VTK)     | Property Editor   |

      | BC / Loads         |                      |                   |
      | Interactions       |                      |                   |
      | Mesh               |                      |                   |
