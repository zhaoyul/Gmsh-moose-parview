* Abaqus-Like UI Refactor Plan
** Status
   - Overall: In Progress
   - Last Update: 2026-02-21

** Goals
   - Provide an Abaqus-like user experience for model setup, solve, and post-processing.
   - Make the app look and feel like a professional simulation suite.
   - Keep the workflow end-to-end: geometry -> mesh -> solve -> results.

** Plan
*** DONE 1. 信息架构与流程定义
    - Abaqus-style Model Tree:
      Parts / Materials / Sections / Steps / BC / Loads / Interactions / Mesh / Jobs / Results
    - Shortest demo workflow:
      Part -> Material -> Section -> Assembly -> Step -> BC/Load -> Mesh -> Job -> Results
    - UI wireframe + view list:
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+
      | Menu/Toolbar                                                  |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+
      | Modules: Part | Property | Assembly | Step | Interaction |    |
      |          Load | Mesh | Job | Visualization                    |
      +--------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
      | Model Tree         |   Viewport (VTK)     | Property Editor   |
      | Parts              |   + 2D/Plot/Table    | Context-sensitive |
      | Materials          |                      | forms             |
      | Sections           |                      |                   |
      | Steps              |                      |                   |
      | BC / Loads         |                      |                   |
      | Interactions       |                      |                   |
      | Mesh               |                      |                   |
      | Jobs               |                      |                   |
      | Results            |                      |                   |
      +--------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
      | Job/Message Console (run log, warnings, progress)             |
      +---------------------------------------------------------------+

*** TODO 5. Mesh Algorithms & Options
    - [X] 2D/3D algorithm selection.
    - [X] Recombine options (quad/hex).
    - [X] Optimization level + smoothing.
    - [X] Element order, high-order optimization.

    - [X] Visual toggles: edges, faces, volume shell.
    - [X] Mesh viewer group filter (sync from Gmsh panel).
    - [X] Mesh viewer element-type filter + opacity/shrink.
    - [X] Mesh pick inspector (cell/group/type/quality).
    - [X] Mesh pick highlight (group/cell) with overlay.
    - [X] View controls (axes/outline/camera presets).
    - [X] Entity-level picking + filter, and pick-to-entity fill.

*** TODO 7. Import/Export Round-Trip

   - [X] Wire import to mesh preview.
   - [X] Add primitives (box/cylinder/sphere) with parameter UI.
   - [X] Add transforms (translate/rotate/scale).
   - [X] Add boolean ops for volumes.

   - [X] Add mesh report + quality stats in log panel.
   - [X] Add geometry/mesh export.
